The definition of model (objects) and end-points is in
/src/main/resources/deep-viss.json

An example implementation from Swagger
/src/main/resources/example-service.json

The code generator is configured in pom.xml
I found two generators:
org.zalando.maven.plugins (probably less maintained)
and one frm
io.swagger
